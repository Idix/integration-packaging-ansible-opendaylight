# The set of Karaf features installed by default in ODL's release artifact.
# You likely don't need to override these. With only these, you'll be
# able to connect to a Karaf shell and poke around ODL, including
# potentially manually installing features, but that's about it.
# It's better to avoid that manual step by overriding the extra_features
# list with the additional ODL features required by your use-case.

# Karaf features to install *in addition* to the default_features list.
# You will likely need to override this. The features you choose will
# be determined by your use-case. You'll be able to get a Karaf
# shell and poke around without any extras, but manually connecting to
# CLIs is an anti-goal for CI/CD and automated deployments generally.

# Specifies the port for the ODL northbound REST interface to listen on.
# This was added because OpenStack's Swift project uses a conflicting port.
