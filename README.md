# OpenDaylight Ansible Role

Ansible role for the [OpenDaylight SDN controller][1].

Releases of this role can also be installed available via [Ansible Galaxy][5].

## Requirements

The OpenDaylight Ansible role handles the installation and configuration of
all of its dependences.

## Role Variables

### Karaf Features

To set extra Karaf features to be installed at OpenDaylight start time,
pass them in a list to the `extra_features` variable. The extra features
you pass will typically be driven by the requirements of your ODL install.
You'll almost certainly need to pass some.

OpenDaylight normally installs a default set of Karaf features at boot.
They are recommended, so the ODL Ansible role defaults to installing them.
This can be customized by overriding the `default_features` variable. You
shouldn't normally need to do so.

### Karaf Feature Repos

To configure additional repos to search for Karaf features, override the
`extra_feature_repos` variable.

OpenDaylight comes with a pre-configured set of Karaf feature repos. They
are recommended, so the ODL Ansible role defaults to installing them. This
can be customized by overriding the `default_features` variable. You shouldn't
normally need to do so.

### REST API Port

To change the port on which OpenDaylight's northbound listens for REST API
calls, use the `odl_rest_port` variable. This was added because OpenStack's
Swift project uses a conflicting port.

The Ansible role will handle opening this port in FirewallD if it's active.

## Dependencies

The OpenDaylight Ansible role doesn't depend on any other Ansible roles.

## Example Playbook

The simple example playbook below would install and configure OpenDaylight
using this role.

```yaml
---
- hosts: example_host
  sudo: yes
  roles:
    - opendaylight
```

To override default settings, pass variables to the `opendaylight` role.

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  sudo: yes
  roles:
    - role: opendaylight
      extra_features: ['odl-ovsdb-openstack']
```

Results in:

```
opendaylight-user@root>feature:list | grep odl-ovsdb-openstack
odl-ovsdb-openstack | 1.1.0-Lithium | x | ovsdb-1.1.0-Lithium <snip>
```
